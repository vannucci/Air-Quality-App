# Full-Stack Engineer Technical Assignment - AQI Location Viewer

_Michael Vannucci, August 2024_

## How To Start

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Make a `.env` file at the root directory, of the following form:

```
VITE_API_TOKEN=XXXXXXX
```

_Note the parameter MUST be called VITE_API_TOKEN or else Vite won't pick it up_

3. Write in your valid token ID in place of the _XXXXXXX_
4. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
5. Run `npm start` and navigate to the indicated localhost address

## How To Run Tests

1. After following the directions above, type `npm test` to run the Vitest unit tests

## Miscellania

I have included my hand written notes that I sketched initially upon receiving this assignment, they include a (rough) sketch of my goals and my plan.

_Thank you!_
